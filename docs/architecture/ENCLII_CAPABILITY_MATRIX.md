# ENCLII PLATFORM - COMPREHENSIVE CAPABILITY MATRIX

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MADFAM-ENCLII-FIRST-LEGACY-RAW v1: This document contains legacy raw infrastructure command examples.
> Routine production operations must use Enclii web, API, or CLI. Treat raw
> `kubectl`, `helm`, SSH, provider CLI/API, `docker exec`, and direct container
> access as platform bootstrap or documented break-glass only, and record any
> missing Enclii adapter gap.

**Status:** 95% Production Ready | **Date:** January 2026 (Updated)

> ⚠️ **Note:** This matrix was originally created Nov 2025. Current infrastructure: single Hetzner dedicated server, self-hosted PostgreSQL/Redis. Core services live at enclii.dev. See internal-devops for cost breakdown.

# PART 9: DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Hetzner Cloud account + API token (Read & Write)
- [ ] Cloudflare account + domain
- [ ] Cloudflare API token (Zone:DNS:Edit, Tunnel:Edit, R2:Edit)
- [ ] Cloudflare R2 enabled with API keys
- [ ] Terraform >= 1.5.0 installed
- [ ] kubectl, hcloud, cloudflared, jq installed
- [ ] Local SSH key for management access

## Deployment Phases

**Phase 1: Infrastructure (30-45 min)**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-production.sh check     # Validate config
./scripts/deploy-production.sh init      # Initialize Terraform
./scripts/deploy-production.sh plan      # Review changes
./scripts/deploy-production.sh apply     # Deploy infrastructure
./scripts/deploy-production.sh kubeconfig # Get cluster access
./scripts/deploy-production.sh post-deploy # Setup services
./scripts/deploy-production.sh status    # Verify deployment
```

**Phase 2: Core Services (15-20 min)**
```bash
# For local dev, apply dev-only manifests first:
kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/base/secrets.dev.yaml
kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/base/postgres.yaml
kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/base/redis.yaml
kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/base/switchyard-api.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=switchyard-api --timeout=300s
```

**Phase 3: Verification**
```bash
curl https://api.enclii.dev/health
curl https://app.enclii.dev/
# Verify all services running
```

# PART 10: RISK ASSESSMENT

## Production Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **Canary gate logic failures** | High | High | Implement test gates, manual approval option |
| **Cost calculation errors** | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout |
| **Cloudflare Tunnel downtime** | Low | High | Fallback ingress, health checks |
| **Redis data loss** | Low | Medium | Sentinel HA, persistence, backups |
| **Database migration failures** | Medium | Critical | Test migrations, rollback plan, backups |
| **Build pipeline bottlenecks** | High | Medium | Scale build workers, caching, rate limits |
| **Secret exposure** | Low | Critical | Sealed Secrets, audit logging, rotation |
| **Multi-tenant data leakage** | Low | Critical | NetworkPolicies, RBAC enforcement, audits |

# PART 11: COST ANALYSIS

## Enclii Infrastructure Cost

See internal-devops for cost breakdown.

```
Hetzner Dedicated Server
Cloudflare (Tunnel, R2, SaaS, DDoS)
Self-hosted PostgreSQL (in-cluster)

Single Redis Instance
  In-cluster (Sentinel staged) $0

─────────────────────────────────
See internal-devops for cost breakdown.
```

## Comparison with Alternatives

| Platform | Model | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Enclii** | Self-hosted | See internal-devops |
| Railway | SaaS | $24,000+ |
| Auth0 | SaaS | $2,640+ |
| Railway + Auth0 | SaaS | $26,640+ |
| DigitalOcean App Platform | $341 | $4,092 |
| AWS ECS Fargate | $300-1,000 | $3,600-12,000 |

**5-Year Savings with Enclii:**
- vs Railway + Auth0: **$127,200**
- vs DigitalOcean: **$19,560**

---

# CONCLUSION

Enclii is a **75% complete, highly ambitious** multi-tenant PaaS platform that matches Railway/Vercel feature-for-feature while delivering **95% cost savings**. The current implementation provides:

✅ **Production-Ready:**
- Multi-tenant isolation
- RBAC authentication
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Service deployment pipeline
- Observability stack
- Audit logging
- Infrastructure-as-Code

⚠️ **Nearly Complete (Weeks 1-2):**
- Cloudflare Tunnel integration
- R2 object storage
- Redis Sentinel HA

🔴 **In Progress (Weeks 3-8):**
- Build pipeline automation
- Janua OAuth integration
- Cost showback
- API key management
- Canary deployment gates
- Automated rollback

The **6-8 week timeline to 95% production readiness** is aggressive but achievable given the solid foundation already in place. The biggest remaining work is in orchestration automation (build pipeline, cost tracking) rather than core infrastructure or security.

**Recommendation: Proceed to production deployment with known gaps; implement gaps in parallel with customer onboarding.**
